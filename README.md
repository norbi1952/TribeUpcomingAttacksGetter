# TribeUpcomingAttacksGetter
TribeUpcomingAttacksGetter allows to get upcoming attacks for all tribe members by clicking one button. 
It generates a list which contains player name with villages coordinates and attacks amount for each village. Players with no villages and villages with no attacks are ignored.

In theory script should work with any language version of "Tribal Wars" game.
